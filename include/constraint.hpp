/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ library 
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem 
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of 
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP. 
 *
 * GHOST has been first developped to help making AI for the RTS game
 * StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used for any kind of applications where 
 * solving combinatorial and optimization problems within some tenth of 
 * milliseconds is needed. It is a generalization of the Wall-in project.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST for further information.

  //! Constraint is the class encoding constraints of your CSP/COP.
  /*! 
   * In GHOST, many different constraint objects can be instanciate.
   *
   * The Constraint class is a template class, waiting for both the
   * type of variable and the type of domain. Thus, you must
   * instanciate a constraint by specifying the class of your variable
   * objects and the class of your domain object, like for instance
   * Constraint<Variable, Domain> or Constraint<MyCustomVariable,
   * MyCustomDomain>, if MyCustomVariable inherits from the
   * ghost::Variable class and MyCustomDomain inherits from the
   * ghost::Domain class.
   *
   * You cannot directly use this class Constraint to encode your CSP/COP
   * constraints, since this is an abstract class (see the list of
   * pure virtual functions below). Thus, you must write your own
   * constraint class inheriting from ghost::Constraint.
   *
   * The only pure virtual Constraint function is v_cost
   *
   * \sa Variable
